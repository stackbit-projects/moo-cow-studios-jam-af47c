      In late 2020, after finding herself out of employment, our founder Kristina Tiffin decided to explore a new direction and flex her creative fingers. A few months later <strong>Moo Cow Design</strong> was born.

          Inspire by a funny "Congratulations" card. Kristina embarked on creating her own range of pun filled
          greetings cards. These were initially sold on Thortful but are now available on both our website and
          Etsy shop.
          <br><br>
          After the success of the greetings cards, Kristina designed the first <strong>Moo Cow Design</strong> collection of
          prints. Mixing her love of all things Disney and a new obsession for minimalist style digital artwork.
          After just a few short weeks, requests came in for new prints based on customers favourite Disney
          films. There are now 17 prints in the collection, including 4 digital downloads.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Moo Cow Design</strong> continues to grow with new products, including individual stickers and sticker
          sheets available soon, as well as bespoke pieces.
